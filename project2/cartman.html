<h1> Eric Theodore Cartman  </h1>
<p>Cartman is the fat, self-centered asshole in the group, often concocting schemes to make money and/or procure Colonel's chicken. He absolutely hates Kyle, despises hippies, and can't stand Family Guy. But he does have a soft spot for Mel Gibson, his stuffed animal Clyde Frog, and cats (especially his own cat, Mr. Kitty). 

After years of trying to discover who his real father is, he recently found out that he's the illegitimate son of Jack Tenorman, making Scott Tenorman his half-brother...and making him largely responsible for killing his own parents. 

Cartman also moonlights as the infamous superhero The Coon. He originally joined forces with the boys to form Coon and Friends, but when they all turned against him, he teamed up with the Dark Lord Cthulhu.
