	<p class="mycss">Q1:What does the app do?
	<br>The idea of this app it to create a app for all the fans of southpark, which contain all the information about it.
	The users can check to see the brief intro of the animation,or check the chart to find his favourite character and get to know the detail information of him/her
	It is like a wikipedia just for southpark. Anyway,the users can also enjoy the gallery of the funny pic in southpark.</p>
	<p class="mycss">Q2:What are the features of it?
	<br>This web app will change the appearance to suit browser,so it is convenient for mobile phone users.Compared to an actual app in ios/Android,it do not
	need to install,you can use it anyplace in any machine.
	<br>Besides that, the app is easy to use, it has a straight forward operation interface,you just need to click the navigation bars and everything is done.</p>
	<p class="mycss">Q3:How does it fill in the need of market place?
	<br>There are southpark fans all around the world but there is not a one web designed for phone about the informations of southpark.
	I have see some applications designed for games and animation, for example the ACNL Guide in ios platform(Animal Crossing Guide), and it is really helpful!
	And my app is kind of similar to it, which means it has commercial value in some way</p>
	<p class="mycss">Q4:What reference did you use to create it?
	<br>Well,basically,I use jQuery mobile to build it. But I also check some model and demos as examples to do it.
	Here are two of them. <a href="http://www.photoswipe.com/latest/examples/04-jquery-mobile.html">Photoswipe</a>
	<a href="http://www.inpixelitrust.fr/demos/restaurant_picker/">Restaurant Picker</a>
	    <p class="mycss">Q5:Are there any missing functions or are there any thing you want to add in the near future?
		<br>I'm sorry but this app it not completed now,check here to see the description of missing functionality

      <p class="mycss">What is missing?
	  <br>In the character section, any category the users click will go to the page of "boys", the other parts are missing because I haven't find all the data and upload to the server.
	  <br>I am going to update more information by collecting picture and introduction of all the characters in southpark official website so if you click in Girls after I update it.
	  It will show a interface like this.
	  <img src="img/IMG_3073.JPG"/width=auto height=500px>
	  The category of adults and non-human is the same structure as shown above .</p>
	  <p class="mycss">What else can we improve?
	  <br>Anyway, I am considering adding some fantastic and cool function on this app.
	  The first one is shown in the picture above,I want to add an rating system for users to rate their favourite characters, I may use database in the cloud to save data.
	  And I also want to improve the personal information page of each character as shown below.
	  <img src="img/IMG_3075.JPG"/width=auto height=500px> So that it will not only contain the intro of the character but also the gallery and videos of him.
